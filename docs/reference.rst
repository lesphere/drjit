.. autoclass:: JitFlag

   .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
      in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

   Flags that control how Dr.Jit compiles and optimizes programs.

   This enumeration lists various flag that control how Dr.Jit compiles and
   optimizes programs, most of which are enabled by default. The status of each
   flag can be queried via :py:func:`drjit.flag` and enabled/disabled via the
   :py:func:`drjit.set_flag` or the recommended
   :py:func:`drjit.scoped_set_flag` functions, e.g.:

   .. code-block:: python

      with dr.scoped_set_flag(dr.JitFlag.SymbolicLoops, False):
          # code that has this flag disabled goes here

   The most common reason to update the flags is to switch between *symbolic*
   and *evaluated* execution of loops and functions. The former eagerly
   executes programs by breaking them into many smaller kernels, while the
   latter records computation symbolically to assemble large *megakernels*. See
   explanations below along with the documentation of :py:func:`drjit.switch`
   and :py:class:`drjit.while_loop` for more details on these two modes.

   Dr.Jit flags are a thread-local property. This means that multiple independent
   threads using Dr.Jit can set them independently without interfering with each
   other.

   .. autoattribute:: Debug
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      **Debug mode**: Enable functionality to uncover errors in application code.

      When debug mode is enabled, Dr. Jit inserts a number of addititional runtime
      checks to locate sources of undefined behavior.

      Debug mode comes at a *significant* cost: it interferes with kernel caching,
      reduces tracing performance, and produce kernels that run slower. We recommend
      that you only use it periodically before a release, or when encountering a
      serious problem like a crashing kernel.

      In debug mode, Dr.Jit inserts additional checks to intercept out-of-bound reads
      and writes performed by operations such as :py:func:`drjit.scatter`,
      :py:func:`drjit.gather`, :py:func:`drjit.scatter_reduce`,
      :py:func:`drjit.scatter_inc`, etc. It also detects calls to invalid callables
      performed via :py:func:`drjit.switch`, :py:func:`drjit.dispatch`. Such invalid
      operations are masked, and they generate a warning message on the console,
      e.g.:

      .. code-block:: pycon
         :emphasize-lines: 2-3

         >>> dr.gather(dtype=UInt, source=UInt(1, 2, 3), index=UInt(0, 1, 100))
         RuntimeWarning: drjit.gather(): out-of-bounds read from position 100 in an array‚èé
         of size 3. (<stdin>:2)

      In debug mode, Dr.Jit also installs a `python tracing hook
      <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace>`__ that
      associates all Jit variables with their Python source code location, and
      this information is propagated all the way to the final intermediate
      representation (PTX, LLVM IR). This is useful for low-level debugging and
      development of Dr.Jit itself. You can query the source location
      information of a variable ``x`` by writing ``x.label``.

      Due to limitations of the Python tracing interface, this handler becomes active
      within the *next* called function (or Jupyter notebook cell) following
      activation of the :py:attr:`drjit.JitFlag.Debug` flag. It does not apply to
      code within the same scope/function.

      C++ code using Dr.Jit also benefits from debug mode but will lack accurate
      source code location information. In mixed-language projects, the reported file
      and line number information will reflect that of the last operation on the
      Python side of the interface.

   .. autoattribute:: ReuseIndices
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      **Index reuse**: Dr.Jit consists of two main parts: the just-in-time
      compiler, and the automatic differentiation layer. Both maintain an
      internal data structure representing captured computation, in which each
      variable is associated with an index (e.g., ``r1234`` in the JIT
      compiler, and ``a1234`` in the AD graph).

      The index of a Dr.Jit array in these graphs can be queried via the
      :py:attr:`ArrayBase.index` and :py:attr:`ArrayBase.index_ad` variables,
      and they are also visible in debug messages (if
      :py:func:`drjit.set_log_level` is set to a more verbose debug level).

      Dr.Jit aggressively reuses the indices of expired variables by default,
      but this can make debug output difficult to interpret. When when
      debugging Dr.Jit itself, it is often helpful to investigate the history
      of a particular variable. In such cases, set this flag to ``False`` to
      disable variable reuse both at the JIT and AD levels. This comes at a
      cost: the internal data structures keep on growing, so it is not suitable
      for long-running computations.

      Index reuse is *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: ConstantPropagation
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      **Constant propagation**: immediately evaluate arithmetic involving
      literal constants on the host and don't generate any device code for
      them.

      For example, the following assertion holds when value numbering is
      enabled in Dr.Jit.

      .. code-block:: python

         from drjit.llvm import Int

         # Create two literal constant arrays
         a, b = Int(4), Int(5)

         # This addition operation can be immediately performed and does
         # not need to be recorded
         c1 = a + b

         # Double-check that c1 and c2 refer to the same Dr.Jit variable
         c2 = Int(9)
         assert c1.index == c2.index

      Constant propagation is *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: ValueNumbering
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      **Local value numbering**: a simple variant of common subexpression
      elimination that collapses identical expressions within basic blocks. For
      example, the following assertion holds when value numbering is enabled in
      Dr.Jit.

      .. code-block:: python

         from drjit.llvm import Int

         # Create two nonliteral arrays stored in device memory
         a, b = Int(1, 2, 3), Int(4, 5, 6)

         # Perform the same arithmetic operation twice
         c1 = a + b
         c2 = a + b

         # Verify that c1 and c2 reference the same Dr.Jit variable
         assert c1.index == c2.index

      Local value numbering is *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: SymbolicCalls
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Dr.Jit provides two main ways of compiling function calls targeting
      *instance arrays*.

      1. **Symbolic mode** (the default): Dr.Jit invokes each callable with
         *symbolic* (abstract) arguments. It does this to capture a transcript
         of the computation that it can turn into a function in the generated
         kernel. Symbolic mode preserves the control flow structure of the
         original program by replicating it within Dr.Jit's intermediate
         representation.

      2. **Evaluated mode**: Dr.Jit evaluates all inputs and groups them by instance
         ID. Following this, it launches a a kernel *per instance* to process the
         rearranged inputs and assemble the function return value.

      A separate section about :ref:`symbolic and evaluated modes <sym-eval>`
      discusses these two options in detail.

      Besides calls to instance arrays, this flag also controls the behavior of
      the functions :py:func:`drjit.switch` and :py:func:`drjit.dispatch`.

      Symbolic calls are *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: OptimizeCalls
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Perform basic optimizations for function calls on instance arrays.

      This flag enables two optimizations:

      - *Constant propagation*: Dr.Jit will propagate literal constants across
        function boundaries while tracing, which can unlock simplifications
        within. This is especially useful in combination with automatic
        differentiation, where it helps to detect code that does not influence
        the computed derivatives.

      - *Devirtualization*: When an element of the return value has the same
        computation graph in all instances, it is removed from the function
        call interface and moved to the caller.

      The flag is *enabled* by default. Note that it is only meaningful in
      combination with :py:attr:`SymbolicCalls`. Besides calls to instance
      arrays, this flag also controls the behavior of the functions
      :py:func:`drjit.switch` and :py:func:`drjit.dispatch`.

   .. autoattribute:: MergeFunctions
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Deduplicate code generated by function calls on instance arrays.

      When ``arr`` is an instance array (potentially with thousands of
      instances), a function call like

      .. code-block:: python

         arr.f(inputs...)

      can potentially generate vast numbers of different callables in the
      generated code. At the same time, many of these callables may contain
      identical code (or code that is identical except for data references).

      Dr.Jit can exploit such redundancy and merge such callables during code
      generation. Besides generating shorter programs, this also helps to
      reduce thread divergence.

      This flag is *enabled* by default. Note that it is only meaningful in
      combination with :py:attr:`SymbolicCalls`. Besides calls to instance
      arrays, this flag also controls the behavior of the functions
      :py:func:`drjit.switch` and :py:func:`drjit.dispatch`.

   .. autoattribute:: SymbolicLoops
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Dr.Jit provides two main ways of compiling loops involving Dr.Jit arrays.

      1. **Symbolic mode** (the default): Dr.Jit executes the loop a single
         time regardless of how many iterations it requires in practice. It
         does so with *symbolic* (abstract) arguments to capture the loop
         condition and body and then turns it into an equivalent loop in the
         generated kernel. Symbolic mode preserves the control flow structure
         of the original program by replicating it within Dr.Jit's intermediate
         representation.

      2. **Evaluated mode**: Dr.Jit evaluates the loop's state variables and
         reduces the loop condition to a single element (``bool``) that
         expresses whether any elements are still alive. If so, it runs the
         loop body and the process repeats.

      A separate section about :ref:`symbolic and evaluated modes <sym-eval>`
      discusses these two options in detail.

      Symbolic loops are *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: OptimizeLoops
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Perform basic optimizations for loops involving Dr.Jit arrays.

      This flag enables two optimizations:

      - *Constant arrays*: variables in the *loop state* set that aren't
        modified by a loop are removed from this set. This shortens the
        generated code, which can be helpful especially in combination with the
        automatic transformations performed by :py:func:`drjit.function` that
        may be somewhat conservative in classifying too many local variables as
        potential loop state.

      - *Literal constant arrays*: In addition to the above point, constant
        loop state variables that are *literal constants* are propagated into
        the loop body, where this may reveal optimization opportunities.

        This is useful in combination with automatic differentiation, where it
        helps to detect code that does not influence the computed derivatives.

      One practical implication of this optimization is that it may cause
      :py:func:`drjit.while_loop` to run the loop body twice instead of just
      once.

      This flag is enabled by default. Note that it is only meaningful in
      combination with  :py:attr:`SymbolicLoops`.

   .. autoattribute:: SymbolicConditionals
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Dr.Jit provides two main ways of compiling conditionals involving Dr.Jit arrays.

      1. **Symbolic mode** (the default): Dr.Jit captures the computation
         performed by the ``True`` and ``False`` branches and generates an
         equivalent branch in the generated kernel. Symbolic mode preserves the
         control flow structure of the original program by replicating it
         within Dr.Jit's intermediate representation.

      2. **Evaluated mode**: Dr.Jit always executes both branches and blends
         their outputs.

      A separate section about :ref:`symbolic and evaluated modes <sym-eval>`
      discusses these two options in detail.

      Symbolic conditionals are *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: ForceOptiX
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Force execution through OptiX even if a kernel doesn't use ray tracing.
      This only applies to the CUDA backend is mainly helpful for automated
      tests done by the Dr.Jit team.

      This flag is *disabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: PrintIR
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Print the low-level IR representation when launching a kernel.

      If enabled, this flag causes Dr.Jit to print the low-level IR (LLVM IR,
      NVIDIA PTX) representation of the generated code onto the console (or
      Jupyter notebook).

      This flag is *disabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: KernelHistory
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Maintain a history of kernel launches to profile/debug programs.

      Programs written on top of Dr.Jit execute in an *extremely* asynchronous
      manner. By default, the system postpones the computation to build large
      fused kernels. Even when this computation eventually runs, it does so
      asynchronously with respect to the host, which can make benchmarking
      difficult.

      In general, beware of the following benchmarking *anti-pattern*:

      .. code-block::

          import time
          a = time.time()
          # Some Dr.Jit computation
          b = time.time()
          print("took %.2f ms" % ((b-a) * 1000))

      In the worst case, the measured time interval may only capture the
      *tracing time*, without any actual computation having taken place.
      Another common mistake with this pattern is that Dr.Jit or the target
      device may still be busy with computation that started *prior* to the ``a
      = time.time()`` line, which is now incorrectly added to the measured
      period.

      Dr.Jit provides a *kernel history* feature, where it creates an entry in
      a list whenever it launches a kernel or related operation (memory copies,
      etc.). This not only gives accurate and isolated timings (measured with
      counters on the CPU/GPU) but also reveals if a kernel was launched at
      all. To capture the kernel history, set this flag just before the region
      to be benchmarked and call :py:func:`drjit.kernel_history()` at the end.

      Capturing the history has a (very) small cost and is therefore
      *disabled* by default.

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated

      Force synchronization after every kernel launch. This is useful to
      isolate severe problems (e.g. crashes) to a specific kernel.

      This flag has a severe performance impact and is *disabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: AtomicReduceLocal
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      Reduce locally before performing atomic memory operations.

      Atomic operations targeting global memory can be very expensive,
      especially when many writes target the same memory address leading to
      *contention*.

      This is a common problem when automatically differentiating computation
      in *reverse mode* (e.g. :py:func:`drjit.backward`), since this
      transformation turns differentiable global memory reads into atomic
      scatter-additions.

      To reduce this cost, Dr.Jit can optionally perform a local reduction that
      uses cooperation between SIMD/warp lanes to resolve all requests
      targeting the same address and then only issuing a single atomic memory
      transaction per unique target. This can reduce atomic memory traffic by
      up to a factor of 32 (CUDA) or 16 (LLVM backend with AVX512).

      This operation only affects the behavior of the :py:func:`scatter_reduce`
      function (and the reverse-mode derivative of :py:func:`gather`).

      This flag is *enabled* by default.

   .. autoattribute:: SymbolicScope
      :annotation:

      .. For Sphinx-related technical reasons, the below comment is replicated
         in docstr.h. Please keep the two in sync when making changes.

      This flag is set to ``True`` when Dr.Jit is currently capturing symbolic
      computation. The flag is automatically managed and should not be updated
      by application code.

      User code may query this flag to check if it is legal to perform certain
      operations (e.g., evaluating array contents).

      Note that this information can also be queried in a more fine-grained
      manner (per variable) using the :py:attr:`drjit.ArrayBase.state` field.

Type traits
-----------

The functions in this section can be used to infer properties or types of
Dr.Jit arrays.

The naming convention with a trailing ``_v`` or ``_t`` indicates whether a
function returns a value or a type. Evaluation takes place at runtime within
Python. In C++, these expressions are all  ``constexpr`` (i.e., evaluated at
compile time.).

Automatic differentiation
-------------------------

.. autoclass:: ADMode

   Enumeration to distinguish different types of primal/derivative computation.

   See also :py:func:`drjit.enqueue()`, :py:func:`drjit.traverse()`.

   .. autoattribute:: Primal
      :annotation:

      Primal/original computation without derivative tracking. Note that this
      is *not* a valid input to Dr.Jit AD routines, but it is sometimes useful
      to have this entry when to indicate to a computation that derivative
      propagation should not be performed.

   .. autoattribute:: Forward
      :annotation:

      Propagate derivatives in forward mode (from inputs to outputs)

   .. autoattribute:: Backward
      :annotation:

      Propagate derivatives in backward/reverse mode (from outputs to inputs)

.. autoclass:: ADFlag

   By default, Dr.Jit's AD system destructs the enqueued input graph during
   forward/backward mode traversal. This frees up resources, which is useful
   when working with large wavefronts or very complex computation graphs.
   However, this also prevents repeated propagation of gradients through a
   shared subgraph that is being differentiated multiple times.

   To support more fine-grained use cases that require this, the flags in the
   following enumeration can be used to control what should and should not be
   destructed.

   See also :py:func:`drjit.traverse()`, :py:func:`drjit.forward_from()`,
   :py:func:`drjit.forward_to()`, :py:func:`drjit.backward_from()`, and
   :py:func:`drjit.backward_to()`.

   .. autoattribute:: ClearNone
      :annotation:

      Clear nothing.

   .. autoattribute:: ClearEdges
      :annotation:

      Delete all traversed edges from the computation graph

   .. autoattribute:: ClearInput
      :annotation:

      Clear the gradients of processed input vertices (in-degree == 0)

   .. autoattribute:: ClearInterior
      :annotation:

      Clear the gradients of processed interior vertices (out-degree != 0)

   .. autoattribute:: ClearVertices
      :annotation:

      Clear gradients of processed vertices only, but leave edges intact. Equal
      to ``ClearInput | ClearInterior``.

   .. autoattribute:: AllowNoGrad
      :annotation:

      Don't fail when the input to a ``drjit.forward`` or ``backward``
      operation is not a differentiable array.";

   .. autoattribute:: Default
      :annotation:

      Default: clear everything (edges, gradients of processed vertices). Equal
      to ``ClearEdges | ClearVertices``.

Safe mathematical functions
---------------------------

Dr.Jit provides "safe" variants of a few standard mathematical operations that
are prone to out-of-domain errors in calculations with floating point rounding
errors.  Such errors could, e.g., cause the argument of a square root to become
negative, which would ordinarily require complex arithmetic. At zero, the
derivative of the square root function is infinite. The following operations
clamp the input to a safe range to avoid these extremes.

.. autofunction:: safe_sqrt
.. autofunction:: safe_asin
.. autofunction:: safe_acos
